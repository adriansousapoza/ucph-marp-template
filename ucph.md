## Text Slide

Wagner's comedy, Die Meistersinger von Nürnberg, celebrates the transformative power of art and love, offering an intense experience in the grand opera format.

Die Meistersinger von Nürnberg centres on a group of medieval master singers vying to be the best. Yet their stringent rules and rigid structures are challenged by the fresh perspective of the youth.

This opera transcends mere entertainment. Wagner skilfully exposes one of his era's harshest critics by depicting him as a pedantic and ludicrous official. Wagner infuses the story with sensual depths; the narrative is Tristan und Isolde turned upside down – a love triangle that ends happily as the older, lovesick master singer generously steps aside for the next generation.

## Quotes


> Our posturings, our imagined self-importance, the delusion that we have some privileged position in the Universe, are challenged by this point of pale light. Our planet is a lonely speck in the great enveloping cosmic dark. In our obscurity, in all this vastness, there is no hint that help will come from elsewhere to save us from ourselves.
> 
> The Earth is the only world known so far to harbor life. There is nowhere else, at least in the near future, to which our species could migrate. Visit, yes. Settle, not yet. Like it or not, for the moment the Earth is where we make our stand.
> 
> It has been said that astronomy is a humbling and character-building experience. There is perhaps no better demonstration of the folly of human conceits than this distant image of our tiny world. To me, it underscores our responsibility to deal more kindly with one another, and to preserve and cherish the pale blue dot, the only home we've ever known.
> 
> <cite>Carl Sagan, Pale Blue Dot: A Vision of the Human Future in Space</cite>

## Nested Quotes


> Friedrich Nietzsche, in *Thus Spoke Zarathustra*, often used the character of Zarathustra to explore profound ideas about perspective, self-overcoming, and the human condition. One notable reflection touches upon how enlightenment or a higher state of being might appear to those who remain unenlightened:
>
>> The higher we soar the smaller we appear to those who cannot fly.
>>
>> <cite>Thus Spoke Zarathustra</cite>
>
> This aphorism suggests the loneliness and misunderstanding that can accompany intellectual or spiritual elevation.

## Equations

The multivariate normal distribution is said to be "non-degenerate" when the symmetric covariance matrix ${\boldsymbol {\Sigma }}$ is positive definite. In this case the distribution has density:

$${\displaystyle f_{\mathbf {X} }(x_{1},\ldots ,x_{k})={\frac {\exp \left(-{\frac {1}{2}}\left({\mathbf {x} }-{\boldsymbol {\mu }}\right)^{\mathrm {T} }{\boldsymbol {\Sigma }}^{-1}\left({\mathbf {x} }-{\boldsymbol {\mu }}\right)\right)}{\sqrt {(2\pi )^{k}|{\boldsymbol {\Sigma }}|}}}}$$

where $x$ is a real $k$-dimensional column vector and $|{\boldsymbol {\Sigma }}|\equiv \det {\boldsymbol {\Sigma }}$ is the determinant of ${\boldsymbol {\Sigma }}$, also known as the generalized variance. The equation above reduces to that of the univariate normal distribution if ${\boldsymbol {\Sigma }}$ is a $1\times 1$ matrix (i.e., a single real number).

| ![width:500px](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8e/MultivariateNormal.png) | In probability theory and statistics, the multivariate normal distribution, multivariate Gaussian distribution, or joint normal distribution is a generalization of the one-dimensional (univariate) normal distribution to higher dimensions. One definition is that a random vector is said to be k-variate normally distributed if every linear combination of its k components has a univariate normal distribution. Its importance derives mainly from the multivariate central limit theorem.
